# weather-report-app

## Description
This project implemented many different Javascript and API concepts. These concepts include the fetch function, which pulls data from a remote API.
Additionally, the data fetched from the API needed to be taken and displayed on the DOM in an organized manner. In order to accomplish this, the page was laid out using CSS grid and flexbox.
That way, the current date card is above the 5 day forecast, while the left-hand sidfe is used for the search bar and search history.
## Features
This weather app includes a variety of functionality including search history buttons which reload the data when pressed, the data laid out in an organized manner, as well as weather icons that represent the daily weather overall. Additionally, the weather app is user-friendly and informative.
